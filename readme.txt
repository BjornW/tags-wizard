Add tags as lists of suggestions to guide less experienced content creators.  

== Description ==
Tags Wizard allows you to customize which and who (role-based) can add tags 
to content. It's main purpose is to guide less experienced content creators 
in adding the 'right' (from a limited set) tags to their content.

Admins can add lists of tags which are allowed & shown in metaboxes next to the 
content. The lists are either per WordPress Multisite Network or per subsite.
Freeform tag input, like WordPress provides out of the box can be limited to 
certain roles.  

The plugin has network & per site settings, does not alter the database 
and only uses hooks to achieve it's goal. It also designed to work perfectly 
with Multisite installations.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `tags-wizard` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin either Network wide or per site, depending on your 
installation
4. Done!
